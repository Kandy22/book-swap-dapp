# Project name

Book Swap-Exchange

# Description

Book Swap is an innovative digital platform that allows you to trade in your books, notes, labs, and more via the largest online decentralized book swapping community in the world.

List your books, contact buyers/sellers, and mail your books to someone who wants them for points and then use your points to buy books from other users. Participating in a book exchange also saves on ink and leaves a smaller environmental footprint than printing a book.

You know that for a book swap to work you need books and a group of book-loving folks who don't mind expanding their literary horizons. The idea is pretty simple: Guests bring books to share, and the accumulated books are then redistributed to new owners.
If you are a book owner you can list your book, provide review references, and more.

## Inspiration

The inspiration came because as a college student or someone who loves to read, I have to spend thousands of hundreds of dollars on books and then lose half of it. We decided to create a platform that protects people's money and the environment

## How we built it

Book Swaps application makes use of the following software:

- `Alfajores Network` enables Book Swap application to be a scalable platform with fast transactions. We deployed our app on the Alfajores Network.

- `Gnosis Network` enables Book Swap application to be a scalable platform with fast transactions. We deployed our app on the Gnosis Network.

- `Matic - Polygon Network` enables Book Swap application to be a scalable platform with fast transactions. We deployed our app on the Polygon Network.

- `Optimism Network` enables our app to be secure and cost-effective. We deployed our app on the Optimism Network
- `Valist` facilitated the process of distribution of our in a secure way.

- `Spheron` made it easy and was the most convenient way to deploy our web app onto a Decentralized Cloud Storage. This allows our users to access our app anywhere in the world.

- `TableLand` made our work easy with the Ethereum network. This allows us to work with a relational database to store Employment references and metadata for EVM chains like Ethereum. We will definitely keep using complex TableLand functions in the future.

- `XMTP` facilitated the process of communication between employers and employees, especially for important employment documents. XMTP allows our users to request employment letters and documents in and seamless and secure way.

- `Covalent API` was really helpful for users' donations and tips. This facilitated the retrieval of usersâ€™ NFTs and smart contract transactions. The Covalent API endpoints to get all NFTs balance and metadata from a wallet address such as images, contracts name, NFTs images, and balances.

* `IPFS NFTStorage` for data storage on IPFS that generates a transaction hash used to create an NFT of a photo.

* `textile/eth-storage`: facilitated a fast way to store metadata for NFTs such: as names, locations, description, images, wallet addresses, and more. It was perfect for our use case to save their needs on the textile storage.

* `NFTPort` smooths the path of the minting and donating process and eliminates the high transaction fees. Our users will not pay anything for donating NFTs or minting.

* `Solidity` for the smart contract.
* `OpenZeppelin ERC721` we use the ERC721 template for faster development of our smart contract.

* `Ganache` for local blockchain development.

* `Rinkeby Network` is the network where we deployed our dApp.

* `React Js, Material-ui, Web3` React Js for the frontend, Material-ui, and Web3 to connect to the blockchain.

## Challenges we ran into

The chat functionality took us longer.
