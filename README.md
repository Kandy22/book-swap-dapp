# Project name

Book Swap

# Description

Trade in your books, notes, labs and more via the largest online decentralized book swapping community in the world.

You know that for a book swap to work you need books and a group of book loving folks who don't mind expanding their literary horizons. The idea is pretty simple: Guests bring books to share, and the accumulated books are then redistributed to new owners.
 If you are a book owner you can list your book, provide reviews references, and more.

# How it's made

Book Swaps application makes use of the following software:

- `Matic - Polygon Network` enables Book Swap application to be a scalable platform with fast transactions. We deployed our app on the Polygon Network.

- `Optimism Network` enables our app to be secure and cost-effective. We deployed our app on the Optimism Network


- `Covalent API` was really helpful for users's donations and tips. This facilitated the retrieval of userâ€™s NFTs and smart contract transactions. The Covalent API endpoints to get all NFTs balance and metadata from a wallet address such as images, contracts name, NFTs images, and balances.

* `IPFS NFTStorage` for data storage on IPFS that generates a transaction hash used to create an NFT of a photo.

* `textile/eth-storage`: facilitated a fast way to store metadata for NFTs such: names, locations, description, images, wallet addresses, and more. It was perfect for our use case to save their needs on the textile storage.

* `NFTPort` smooths the path of minting and donating process and eliminates the high transaction fees.  Our users will no pay anything for donating NFTs or minting.


* `Solidity` for the smart contract.
* `OpenZeppelin ERC721` we use the ERC721 template for faster development of our smart contract.

* `Ganache` for local blockchain development.

* `Rinkeby Network` is the network where we deployed our dApp.

* `React Js, Material-ui, Web3` React Js for the frontend, Material-ui, and Web3 to connect to the blockchain.
